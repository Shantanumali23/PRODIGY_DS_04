# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Analyzer  
This repository contains the implementation for **Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 4** — analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
What’s included:

✅ Data collection from social media platforms (Twitter API / sample datasets)  
✅ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
✅ Sentiment labeling (using TextBlob / VADER / pre-trained models)  
✅ Exploratory data analysis (word clouds, sentiment distribution)  
✅ Data visualization (bar graphs, pie charts, trend lines)  
✅ Sentiment classification using machine learning models

---

## 📁 Files  
- `Prodigy_Infotech_Task_4.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full code and documentation  
- `social_media_data.csv`: Collected social media data with text and metadata  
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing charts and word clouds  
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies  

---

## 🛠️ Main Workflow  

### 1. Load Data  
Import social media posts using API or CSV.

### 2. Preprocess Text  
Clean text: remove punctuation, stopwords, perform stemming/lemmatization.

### 3. Analyze Sentiment  
Use NLP libraries (e.g., TextBlob/VADER) to score sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### 4. Visualize Trends  
- Sentiment distribution pie chart  
- Word clouds for each sentiment  
- Timeline analysis of sentiment trends

### 5. Train Classifier *(Optional)*  
Use models like Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes to classify sentiment.

## 📊 Final Results  
- 📈 Positive Sentiment: 47%  
- 📉 Negative Sentiment: 29%  
- 😐 Neutral Sentiment: 24%  
- ✅ Accuracy of classifier (if applied): ~85%

---

## ✨ Future Work  
- Incorporate topic modeling (LDA) to discover trending themes  
- Build real-time sentiment dashboard using Streamlit  
- Explore deep learning models like BERT for improved sentiment accuracy  
- Analyze sentiment impact on brand perception
